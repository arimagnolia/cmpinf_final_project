# cmpinf_final_project - Group #24

This project looked at safety as a metric.  The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the one that is safest based on the number of firearms seized and arrests made in the neighborhood, the number of building fires recorded in the neighborhood, as well as the neighborhood's median age of death for Blacks and Whites.
